Chapter1 Spun (Final Edited)

## The Gates of Morning: Chapter 1 - Karolin's Dawn

Dick perched on a coral ledge, the southern horizon a smoldering line against the sky. The ocean roared behind him, waves crashing, spray whipped by the wind.  Before him, Karolin's lagoon shimmered, a tranquil expanse of blue dotted with gulls.  This lagoon, enclosed by a forty-mile reef, was his—since yesterday.

The beach bustled. Women, children, and young men worked under the relentless sun, fishing, playing, mending their clothes. His people. Empty canoe houses lined the shore, silent reminders of war, now his responsibility.

His brow furrowed. His gaze shifted from the calm lagoon to the silent houses, then to the restless ocean and the northern sea. Beyond the horizon, invisible yet ever-present, loomed Palm Tree—a paradise, beautiful and dangerous.

Little Tari, Le Taioi's son, watched from the coral.  Tari, barely a man, knew one thing: war had swept away Karolin's men, leaving women and children vulnerable. Then, yesterday, a strange boat arrived from the north, bearing a stranger—Dick—and Katafa, the girl lost at sea.  Women whispered of gods, of a divinely sent chief.

Tari blurted, "Taori, who are you?"

The question echoed the chaos within Dick. He saw Kearney's toy ships, felt the burn of fire, the salt spray on his face as he and Katafa escaped. He saw the terror in Katafa's eyes, the awe on the women's faces.  The past felt distant, a haze of sun-drenched days and violent storms. His present began with Katafa.

He looked at Tari.  "I am Taori, Tari," he said. "Why do you ask?"

"I don't know," Tari replied, already distracted. "But the grown-ups never answer… Look! Fish!" He darted away.

Dick's gaze returned north. Tari's question stirred a painful memory: the schooner, the fire, the escape, the women's awe. And the men left behind on Palm Tree.

No immediate fear, not yet. Palm Tree islanders lacked canoes, but he knew it was a matter of time. They would build canoes, see Karolin's reflection in the sky, and come.  It might take time, but they would come. He was a newcomer, yet his strategic mind remained sharp. He’d summoned Aioma, Palia, and Tafata—skilled canoe builders—and the sight of nearly a hundred young men approaching fighting age filled him with grim determination.  Above all, his love for Katafa fueled his plans. A persistent threat sharpened his instincts.

War canoes? Defend? Or strike first? The answer eluded him.

A hand touched his shoulder. Katafa.  A stray lock of dark hair brushed his cheek. Her usually luminous eyes were fixed on the north.

"Look," she whispered.

Through shimmering heat haze, Palm Tree reappeared—a faint smudge, then the beautiful, ethereal island of their nightmares. They stood together, silent, reliving their escape, the terror, the cries of the drunken men, the island's savage heart.

Dick's nostrils flared. They had threatened him; worse, Katafa.  The threat lingered. Someday, they would come. They would build canoes and come. Driven by greed, they would scan the horizon, and the lagoon's reflection would guide them to Karolin.

He understood. Danger lurked where greed, desire, and hatred thrived—from savages, and from civilized wolves. His world was the ocean surrounding these two islands. He’d learned to fear men, to understand their terrifying capacity for war.

Then, Palm Tree faded. Katafa pointed south. A canoe, sleek and strong, approached, carrying the canoe builders. Leaving the coral ledge, Dick and Katafa walked toward the beach, the rhythmic sound of the approaching canoe a counterpoint to the silent menace of Palm Tree.
