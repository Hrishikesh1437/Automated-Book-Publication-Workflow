## Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder

Dick stood on a coral ledge, his gaze fixed on the southern horizon.  Behind him, the Pacific roared, its spray whipped into a frenzy by the wind.  Before him, the lagoon of Karolin stretched out – a vast, tranquil expanse of sapphire, alive with the cries of fishing gulls.  This breathtaking lagoon, ringed by forty miles of coral, was his.  His, despite having arrived just yesterday.

The beach throbbed with life: women, children, young men, all the tribe, toiling under the relentless sun. They fished with nets, played games, mended their paraka patches – all his people now.  The canoes hauled up on the sand, the empty houses that once held war canoes – all his.

But as his eyes shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, a shadow fell across his face.  He turned his back to the placid waters, facing the churning ocean to the north.  Beyond the horizon, invisible but ever-present in his mind, lay Palm Tree Island – a paradise veiled in darkness, a place teeming with devils.

Little Tari, the net-maker Le Taioi’s son, looked up at him from his perch on the coral. Tari, barely a man himself, understood the tribe’s vulnerability. War had swept away their men, leaving the women, children, and boys defenseless, leaderless.  Then, yesterday, a strange boat arrived from the north, carrying Dick and Katafa – the girl lost at sea years ago.  The women hailed them as godsends, destined to rule.

Tari, oblivious to the concept of gods, blurted out his simple question, unburdened by adult complexities:  “Taori,” he asked, “who are you?”

Dick could have told him the truth – a tale of a life beyond this paradise. He could have explained he was Dick Lestrange, a boy abandoned on Palm Tree with an old sailor named Kearney. He could have described Kearney teaching him to fish, crafting toys, building little ships unlike any Karolin canoe. He could have recounted Katafa's arrival, their life together, their escape from the brutal Melanesians who had slaughtered Kearney and burned their ship.  He could have shared their perilous journey to Karolin, guided by the lagoon's shimmering light in the night sky.

But he couldn't. The name "Dick" felt distant, the language of his childhood lost. Kearney was fading into a hazy past, consumed by the island's blinding sun, relentless storms, and monsoon mists. Only the little ships remained, tangible echoes of that forgotten life.  His past began with Katafa on Palm Tree; everything before that was shrouded in a sun-drenched oblivion.

He looked down at the curious child. “I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?”

“I don’t know,” Tari replied.  “I ask like I breathe, but the grown-ups never answer my questions... Ai, the fish!”  His attention already diverted by playing children hauling in a net, he scampered away.

Dick's gaze returned to the north. Tari’s question had unlocked memories: the schooner, the Melanesian attack, the desperate escape with Katafa in Kearney's old dinghy, their arrival on this beach, the tribe's welcoming embrace – and the burning hatred that still consumed him.

He wasn't immediately afraid of the Palm Tree men – they lacked canoes. But they would build them. They would see the glint of Karolin's lagoon on the horizon, just as he had, and they would come.  It might be years, but they would come.

Dick was a kanaka, a savage, but the white man within him remained. He could strategize, anticipate, envision.  That’s why he'd sent a canoe for Aioma, Palia, and Tafata – three old men, skilled canoe-builders, vital to his plan.  He saw the potential in the tribe's nearly one hundred young men, ripe for war. But underlying everything, fueling his daring, was his love for Katafa – his other self, constantly threatened.

War canoes – for defense, or offense? To repel invaders or strike preemptively?  The answer remained unclear.

A hand rested on his shoulder.  Katafa. A stray lock of her dark hair, unbound from the vine, danced in the breeze like an eagle's feather.  Her luminous eyes, instead of meeting his, were fixed on the north, mirroring his own gaze.

"Look," she whispered.

Through a rare atmospheric anomaly, Palm Tree shimmered into view – a phantom island rising from the sea's embrace, painted on the horizon by an unseen artist.  They had seen it last night, and now it returned, breathtakingly beautiful, yet a haunting reminder of their escape.

Shoulder to shoulder, they silently watched. The nightmare re-emerged: savage figures, the wind in their sails, the cries of drunken Melanesians, the burning ship.  The beauty of the island was a cruel disguise for the demons within.

Dick's nostrils flared, his eyes filled with hate.  They had threatened him, but more importantly, they had threatened Katafa. And they still did.

Some day, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree was a prophecy, echoing his own instincts. They would build canoes, see the lagoon's light, and come.  They craved women, and Karolin's women were their prize.  The horizon held a threat, not just from savages, but from the wolves of civilization itself.

Dick's world was bounded by the ocean, a small universe containing only Karolin and Palm Tree.  He knew no Europe, no America, no history beyond his short life and Katafa's. Yet, even in that limited experience, he grasped the dark undercurrents of humanity – the instinct for war, plunder, destruction.

Slowly, Palm Tree faded, vanished like a snuffed candle.  As they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to an approaching canoe.  The canoe-builders had arrived. Leaving the coral ledge, they walked towards the beach to meet them.
